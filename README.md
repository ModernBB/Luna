ModernBB 2.0 "Zoe"
==================

## About
ModernBB is an open source forum application released under the GNU General Public Licence v3. It is free to download and use and will remain so. ModernBB was conceived and designed to be fast and light with less of the "not so essential" features that some of the other forums have whilst not sacrificing essential functionality or usability.

## Requirements
 - A webserver
 - PHP 5.0.0 or later
 - A database <br />
 -- MySQL 5.0.1 or later <br />
 -- MariaDB 5.3.4 of later <br />
 -- PostgreSQL 7.0 or later <br />
 -- SQLite 2

## Recommendations
 - Make use of a PHP accelerator such as APC or XCache
 - Make sure PHP has the zlib module installed to allow ModernBB to gzip output
